Title: Read and Manipulate Data from 'RiverWare' 
Description: A tool to read and manipulate data generated from 'RiverWare'(TM) 
    <http://www.riverware.org/> simulations. 'RiverWare' and 'RiverSMART'

    interface to read, aggregate, and summarize data from one or more 
    simulations in a 'dplyr' pipeline.
